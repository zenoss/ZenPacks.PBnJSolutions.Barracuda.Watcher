Background information on this ZenPack is available in the README.txt, here I
focus on installation requirements only:

- The datasource is a PERL script called check_cuda.  It uses generic PERL
  code but does rely on XML::Simple which you may have to install
- The PERL script in turn uses wget to retrieve the Barracuda's basic
  statistics page; you may need to install it
- The rrd Template assumes your Zenoss installation is at /usr/local/zenoss;
  you may need to change that assumption

Finally note that the template associated with this ZenPack defines it self
under /Devices/Network so your Barracuda device should be located somewhere at
or below this point.
